## üß† YOLO Quality Analysis

### How It Works

1. **Image Upload**: Sellers upload high-quality images of their produce
2. **YOLO Processing**: The YOLOv8 model analyzes the image for:
   - Object detection and classification
   - Size estimation
   - Color analysis
   - Shape regularity
   - Surface quality assessment
   - Defect detection

3. **Quality Scoring**: Multiple metrics are combined to generate an overall quality score:
   - **Size Score** (20%): Based on object size and uniformity
   - **Color Score** (25%): Color consistency and freshness indicators
   - **Shape Score** (20%): Shape regularity and expected form
   - **Surface Score** (25%): Surface smoothness and defect presence
   - **Freshness Score** (10%): Overall freshness indicators

4. **Grading System**:
   - **Grade A** (80-100%): Premium quality
   - **Grade B** (60-79%): Good quality
   - **Grade C** (40-59%): Average quality
   - **Grade D** (0-39%): Below average quality

### Custom Model Training

To use your own trained YOLO model:

1. Train your model using Ultralytics YOLOv8
2. Save the model weights (.pt file)
3. Update `YOLO_MODEL_PATH` in settings
4. Restart the application

```python
# settings.py
YOLO_MODEL_PATH = '/path/to/your/custom_model.pt'
```

## üöÄ Deployment

### Docker Deployment

1. **Create Dockerfile**
```dockerfile
FROM python:3.11-slim

WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

COPY . .
RUN python manage.py collectstatic --noinput

EXPOSE 8000
CMD ["gunicorn", "agrimart.wsgi:application", "--bind", "0.0.0.0:8000"]
```

2. **Build and run**
```bash
docker build -t agrimart .
docker run -p 8000:8000 agrimart
```

### Production Considerations

- Use PostgreSQL or MySQL for database
- Configure Redis for caching
- Set up Nginx for static file serving
- Use Celery for background tasks
- Configure proper logging
- Set up monitoring and alerts
- Enable SSL/HTTPS
- Configure backup strategy
